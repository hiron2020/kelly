Kelly criterion for trade optimization and risk management

EPAT Final Project Hiroshi Nomura (Dec 2021)

Project Abstract

Firstly, we briefly discuss an overview of the Kelly criterion, with illustrative examples using the coin toss and the more complex dice roll bet. Next, we will apply this to real life markets using 15 year historical data of the SPY ETF and back-test with various strategies and scenarios. We highlight our findings both positive and negative, and how to further optimize the strategy so that it can be applied in practice. Lastly, we will discuss the limitations and how we can make best use of the Kelly criterion in practice as an upper limit for sizing/leverage for our trades. Suggestions for further investigation are also made for future projects.
